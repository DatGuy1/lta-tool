# How can I help?
If you would like to help on the technical side of things, you can start a pull request or help out at the [phabricator project](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/tool-labs-tools-lta-knowledgebase/).

If you would like to help with the project itself, then you could become a tool admin and help approve/deny accounts!
